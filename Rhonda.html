      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Wander</strong> </dt>
        <dd> <em>The best advice we can give you is to just wander the streets of Ronda. There is so much the city has to offer and you'll find all of it by just walking around. Take water and sunscreen if you're going in the summer. There's really no shortage of incredible views in this city.</em></dd>
        <dt><strong>El Tajo gorge</strong></dt>
        <dd> <em>Don't leave the city without taking in the El Tajo gorge. This is the heart of Ronda with a rocky drop plummenting over 100 meters down to the Guadalevin River. <br> The gorge cuts right through the centre of Ronda and splits the town in two. On one side is the Moorish old town and on the other is the 15th century El Mercadillo.</em></dd>
        <dt><strong>The plaza del Socorro</strong></dt>
        <dd><em>This is a beautiful plaza in the middle of the 'new' town. However we advise that you don't eat here as the restaurants are okay and the prices are crazy.</em></dd>

        <dt><strong>The Atico Exclusivo en Ronda</strong></dt>

        <dt><strong>Aire De Ronda</strong></dt>
        <dd><em>Located in a particularly tranquil part of town, this hotel is one of those old-on-the-outside, supermodern-on-the-inside places that Spain does so well.</em></dd>
