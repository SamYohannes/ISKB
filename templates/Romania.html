        <dd>Bucharest is easily a city you can walk around. If you have time its well worth exploring the whole city. Venture out north to find the Garden of Eden.

        <dt>Chill out and soak in the Romanian lifestyle</dt>
        <dd> Go to Podstel/Veainaria 5 for multiple activity evenings. This is also a hostel, and has board game nights, local musicians perfom, yoga classes and more.<br> No one ever said Romanian's didn't know how to tick all the boxes.</dd>
        <dt>World's largest collection of Irons</dt>
        <dd> Okay this is a bit of a weird and wacky one, but can you really pass up the opportunity? They have the normal day to day iron to torpedo-shaped irons for shaping hats.</dd>
