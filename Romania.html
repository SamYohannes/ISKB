        <dd>Bucharest is easily a city you can walk around. If you have time its well worth exploring the whole city. Venture out north to find the Garden of Eden. You'll really have to find it as its rucked away down one of the back streets.<br> It's worth spending at least an hour or two here.  </dd>
        <dt>Chill out and soak in the Romanian lifestyle</dt>
        <dd> Go to Podstel/Veainaria 5 for multiple activity evenings. This is also a hostel, and has board game nights, local musicians perfom, yoga classes and more.<br> No one ever said Romanian's didn't know how to tick all the boxes.</dd>
        <dt>World's largest collection of Irons</dt>
        <dd> Okay this is a bit of a weird and wacky one, but can you really pass up the opportunity? They have the normal day to day iron to torpedo-shaped irons for shaping hats.</dd>
