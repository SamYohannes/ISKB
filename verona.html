      <dl>
        <dt>Off the beaten path</dt>
        <dd> Start your trip with a cappuccino on Piazza Bra- Verona's unoffical arrival hall. <br>Here, medieval walls stand side to side with Renaissance architecture, but it's the Roman amphitheatre that steals the show- 10 Euros for entry.</dd>
        <dt>Exploring the streets</dt>
        <dd> Next hit the streets and head for piazza Delle Erbe. Walk through Via Mazzini to get there and explore Verona's shopping streets along the way.</dd>
        <dt>Verona's Balcony</dt>
        <dd> This is the busiest spot in Verona so try to get there early to make sure you get the full view. Take a pen and write on Juliets wall to mark your stay.<br> If you didn't know this suppousdly where Romeo and Juliet met. You can feel the romance.</dd>
